# Natalie Zarowny — Portfolio (V1)

This is a simple static site (HTML/CSS) designed to feel warm and not corporate.

## Quick publish (Netlify — easiest)
1. Create a free Netlify account.
2. On Netlify: Add new site → Deploy manually.
3. Drag-and-drop the entire folder contents (or the provided zip) into Netlify.
4. You’ll get a live URL immediately.

## Custom domain later (optional)
You can keep your domain in Squarespace and point it to Netlify later:
- Netlify will give you the DNS records (usually a couple A records + a CNAME).
- In Squarespace Domains → DNS Settings, add those records.
This is reversible (you can point it back to Squarespace anytime).

## Editing content
- Home: index.html
- Work: work.html
- About: about.html
- Contact: contact.html
- Styles: styles.css
- Headshot: assets/natalie-zarowny.jpg

## Next iteration ideas
- Replace "In Development" placeholder with your short film details.
- Add a Resume PDF embed.
- Add filters on the Work page (Branded / Editorial / In Dev).
